# Skill spotter
Skill spotter is an project prepeared for Best Hacking League 9th hackhaton edition held in Warsaw. The task of the group was to find out the way to improve
companie's business processes and find some innotiative idea to improve woring at companies. What we firstly thought of, was communication and finding requirements
for the projects and people who have some knowledge about some modules written in the company - like for instance firebase. We created an aggregation of the tickets
stored on Azure-Devops and gave the possibility to the user to search via accepptance-criteria, name of task, hours spend, starting ending date etc. We believe that 
such idea would reduce the time spent to understand the requirements and of course will speed up the development process.

# Technology stack
We wrote the application on the backend in Java 17 and the following dependencies:
- Spring
- Azure-Open-Ai
